# Model Energy Efficiency

You are a data scientist working for Green Architecture, a large architectural firm focused on designing energy-efficient buildings. The architects need a machine learning model that can quickly predict the heating and cooling loads of a building given its high-level attributes, such as roof area, window area, height, and orientation. Green Architecture's Director of Technology has tasked you with building and tuning this model to provide immediate feedback on energy efficiency to the architects as they develop their designs. The Director expects you to train, tune and evaluate several different model types given data on the known energy efficiency of existing buildings and recommend the best model and parameters for predicting the heating and cooling loads of new building designs.
